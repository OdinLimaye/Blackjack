This is a program that I wrote in Java that simulates playing a game of Blackjack with multilpe players.
It keeps track of each player's money, deals hands, runs the dealer's actions, decides the winner of each hand, 
distributes bets accordingly, and allows for players to withdraw dynamically. 
This program is entirely of my own design.
